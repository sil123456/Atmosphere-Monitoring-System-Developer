• Designed an IoT based weather monitoring system using Python on Raspberry Pi. Able to constantly capture
data about the current local temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor.
• Sensed temperature and humidity approximately every 1 minute, generated the averages of both quantities
hourly and displayed on LCD.
